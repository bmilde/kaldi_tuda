This recipe and collection of scripts enables you to train large vocabulary German acoustic models for speaker-independent automatic speech recognition (ASR) with [Kaldi](http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/). The scripts currently use three freely available German speech corpora: The Tuda-De corpus is recorded with a Microsoft Kinect and two other microphones in parallel at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and has been released under a permissive license [(CC-BY 4.0)](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). This corpus compromises ~31h of training data per microphone and ~5h separated into development and test partitions. We also make use of the German subset from the [Spoken Wikipedia Corpora (SWC)](https://nats.gitlab.io/swc/), containing about 285h of additional data and the German subset of [m-ailabs read speech data corpus](http://www.m-ailabs.bayern/en/the-mailabs-speech-dataset/) [(mirror)](https://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/) (237h). Recently we also added the German Commonvoice corpus from Mozilla (https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/de) with 370h of data. We use the test/dev sets from Tuda-De for WER evaluations.

The newest recipe (s5\_r2) trains and tests on data from multiple microphones by default (all but Realtek - about 127h of audio in total). By editing run.sh you can also restrict it to a single microphone (e.g. only Kinect). It also trains on SWC data and M-ailabs by default, too, resulting in 630h of speech data in total after cleaning. See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10311) for more information and WER results. More recent results are in the table in the [pretrained models](#pretrained-models) section.

The old s5 recipe used in [our previous paper](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/publications/2015-radeck-arnethetal-tsd2015-speechcorpus.pdf) is also still available and trained only on the beamformed data of the Kinect microphone, checkout the README.md in the s5 directory if you want to reproduce the results of our old paper.  

The scripts will ask you where to place larger files and can download all necessary files (speech corpus, German texts, phoneme dictionaries) to train the acoustic and language models. You can also download these resources manually, see Section "Getting data files separately" down below.

## News

6 April 2021 
- We have added const arpa language models for rescoring (trained on 100 million sentences). These did reduce error rates further, our best result on tuda-de test is 11.85% WER now. A pre-trained RNN-LM will soon be available as well.

2 July 2020
- We have added two new pretrained models: tuda_swc_mailabs_cv_voc683k and tuda_swc_mailabs_cv_voc683k_smaller_fst, both trained on 1000h of speech data and with our new LM.
- The new model has a 13% lower WER on tuda-test. It also contains many more new and uptodate words and a better phoneme lexicon. See [pretrained models](#pretrained-models) for more details and download links.
- You can also check out [kaldi-model-server](https://github.com/uhh-lt/kaldi-model-server), our PyKaldi based solution to easily load our Kaldi models.

12 June 2020

- We have added the Common Voice (de) dataset, the total amount of training data is over 1000h now!
- We added a new language model (LM) trained on 100 million normalized German sentences, with recent data as well
- We now ship a pre-trained ARPA for the LM, but you can also crawl and normalize your own data with the steps detailed in https://github.com/bmilde/german-asr-lm-tools/
- Some errors in the phoneme inventory have been corrected. You will need to train the new model from scratch, as the phoneme inventories are incompatible.
- A new manual lexicon resource has been added to kaldi-tuda-de, with recent words as well. Adds 13K+ manually verified lexicon words in X-SAMPA-DE format. See https://github.com/uhh-lt/kaldi-tuda-de/blob/master/s5_r2/local/de_extra_lexicon.txt
- We created a lexicon editor to add and verify manual phoneme entries with active learning: https://github.com/uhh-lt/speech-lex-edit
- New pre-trained ASR models will follow shortly

5 March 2019

- A new pretrained model with a vocabulary of 400 thousand words is available: [download](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/kaldi_tuda_de/de_400k_nnet3chain_tdnn1f_2048_sp_bi.tar.bz2)

- We added more aligned speech data (630h total now), thanks to the [m-ailabs speech data corpus](http://www.m-ailabs.bayern/en/the-mailabs-speech-dataset/) [(mirror)](https://www.caito.de/2019/01/the-m-ailabs-speech-dataset/). We also thank Pavel Denisov for sending us a Kaldi data preparation script for this new open source corpus.

21 August 2018

- A new pretrained model with a vocabulary of 350 thousand words is available: [download](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/kaldi_tuda_de/de_350k_nnet3chain_tdnn1f_1024_sp_bi.tar.bz2)

- This model is also the best performing one in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10311).

- This model has also been succesfully tested in the popular [Kaldi Gstreamer Server software](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server). The paths in this package are organized according to the Kaldi Gstreamer examples, a matching kaldi_tuda_de_nnet3_chain.yaml configuration file is included. A worker startup script is also included (run_tuda_de.sh), but you will probably need to change paths. See also the Kaldi + Gstreamer Server Software installation guide [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmilde/ambientsearch/master/INSTALL_KALDI).

15 August 2018

- We thank Sven Hartrumpf for fixing xml files with incorrect transcriptions in the Tuda corpus! A new release of the corpus data will soon be available.

26 July 2018

- Our paper "Open Source Automatic Speech Recognition for German" is accepted at [ITG2018](https://www.uni-oldenburg.de/itg2018/) (10.-12. October 2018, Oldenburg, Germany)! [A preprint of the paper is available here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10311).

Most WER numbers in the table are using Kaldi's FST for decoding without rescoring. We have now added results for rescoring as well, which improves the FST decoding results further as expected. Note that you can also get an additional improvement with a better language using RNN-LM rescoring, see [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10311) for more details. 

We have developed a PyKaldi based solution to use the models with either a local microphone or network streaming in real time: https://github.com/uhh-lt/kaldi-model-server

Another option to use the models is the [Kaldi gstreamer server project](https://github.com/alumae/kaldi-gstreamer-server). You can either stream audio and do online (real-time) recogniton with it or send wav files via http and get a JSON result back. See also the Kaldi + Gstreamer Server Software installation guide [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmilde/ambientsearch/master/INSTALL_KALDI). There is a run_tuda_de.sh in the package that starts Kaldi gstreamer workers for tuda_de. You will need to modify the KALDI_ROOT variable in the script so that it finds your Kaldi installation properly.

# Training your own models

If you want to adapt our models (add training data, augment training data, change vocabulary, ...), you will need to retrain our models. A workstation or server with more than 32GB memory might be needed, having access to a lot of CPU cores is recommended and a recent Nvidia GPU is needed to train neural models such as the TDNN-HMM.

## Prerequisites

The scripts are only tested under Linux (Ubuntu 16.04). Download and install Kaldi and follow the installation instructions. You can download a recent version using git:

```
 git clone https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git kaldi-trunk --origin golden
```

In Kaldi trunk:

1. go to tools/  and follow INSTALL instructions there.

2. Install a BLAS library. This can be Intel MKL, OpenBLAS or Atlas.

If you have an Intel CPU the easist and now recommended library is to install Intel MKL. You can install it easily on Debian/Ubuntu by running extras/install_mkl.sh. You can then skip the rest of this section and go to section 3.

Cross platform solution: Download and install OpenBLAS, build a non-multithreading (important!) library with:

```
make USE_THREAD=0 USE_LOCKING=1 FC=gfortran
```

Now follow the displayed instructions to install OpenBLAS headers and libs to a new and empty directory. 

**Warning! It is imperative to build a single threaded OpenBLAS library**, otherwise you will encounter hard to debug problems with Kaldi as Kaldis parallelization interferes with the OpenBLAS one.

3. go to src/ and follow INSTALL instructions there. Intel MKL is found automatically, if you installed with OpenBLAS point the configure script to your OpenBLAS installation (see ./configure --help).

**Our scripts are meant to be placed into its own directory in KALDIs egs/ directory.** This is also where all the other recipes reside in. If you want to build DNN models, you probably want to enable CUDA in KALDI with the configure script in src/. You should have a relatively recent Nvidia GPU, at least one with the Kepler architecture.

You also need Sequitur G2P (https://www-i6.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/web/Software/g2p.html, https://github.com/sequitur-g2p/sequitur-g2p). Download the package and run make, then edit the sequitur\_g2p variable in s5\_r2/cmd.sh to point to the g2p.py script.  

You will also need a recent version of Python 3. Package requirements are:

```
pip3 install beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

Additinally, the requests package was previously used to communicate with MaryTTS to generate phonemizations, however you won't need it if you run the standard setup.

## Building the acoustic models

After you have installed the prerequisites, edit cmd.sh in the s5\_r2/ directory of this distribution to adjust for the number of processors you have locally (change nJobs and nDecodeJobs accordingly). You could probably also uncomment the cluster configuration and run the scripts on a cluster, but this is untested and may require some tinkering to get it running.

Then, simply run ./run.sh in s5_r2/ to build the acoustic and language models. The script will ask you where to place larger files (feature vectors and KALDI models) and automatically build appropriate symlinks. [Kaldi_lm](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/kaldi/kaldi_lm.tar.gz) is automatically downloaded and compiled if it is not found on your system and standard Kneser-Ney is used for a 4-gram LM.

## Getting data files separately

You can of course also use and download our data resources separately.

### Speech corpus

The corpus can be downloaded [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/kaldi_tuda_de/german-speechdata-package-v2.tar.gz). The license is [CC-BY 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
The run.sh script expects to find the corpus data extracted in data/wav/ and will download it for you automatically, if it does not find the data.

Newer recipes also make use of [SWC data](https://nats.gitlab.io/swc/).

### German language texts

Preprocessed read sentences from the [German Wikipedia](https://de.wikipedia.org/), the [European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/) and a crawled corpus of direct speech can be found [here](http://ltdata1.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/kaldi_tuda_de/German_sentences_8mil_filtered_maryfied.txt.gz)
 
The scripts expect to find one gzipped text file containing all the sentences (each on its own line) in data/local/lm/cleaned.gz

The preproccesing with [MARY](http://mary.dfki.de/) canonicalizes numbers, literals and abbreviations and removes all punctuation. E.g. 51 is changed into "einundf√ºnfzig". Spelling is currently not canonicalized, but rules to translate from old German spellings (pre-1996 and pre-2004/06) are planned for a later release.

If you want to preprocess your own texts, you can use s5/local/maryfy\_corpus.py.

```
python s5/local/maryfy_corpus.py --help
```

should point you into the right direction. You need to supply the path of the MARY server start script. MARY will unfortunately have problems if you try to process millions of lines of text in one go and it might become unresponsive with all its processing threads being stuck in endless loops. The current quick hack implemented in maryfy_corpus.py will routinely call "killall java" and then restart MARY. This of course only works, if you have no other Java programs running under your username besides MARY. 

### German phoneme dictionary

The phoneme dictionary is currently not supplied with this distribution, but the scripts to generate them are. DFKIs MARY includes a nice [LGPL German phoneme dictionary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marytts/marytts/master/marytts-languages/marytts-lang-de/lib/modules/de/lexicon/de.txt) with ~26k entries. Other sources for phoneme dictionary entries can be found at [BAS](ftp://ftp.bas.uni-muenchen.de/pub/BAS). Our parser understands the different formats of     [VM.German.Wordforms](ftp://ftp.bas.uni-muenchen.de/pub/BAS/VM/VM.German.Wordforms), [RVG1_read.lex](ftp://ftp.bas.uni-muenchen.de/pub/BAS/RVG1/RVG1_read.lex), [RVG1_trl.lex](ftp://ftp.bas.uni-muenchen.de/pub/BAS/RVG1/RVG1_trl.lex) and [LEXICON.TBL](ftp://ftp.bas.uni-muenchen.de/pub/BAS/RVG-J/LEXICON.TBL).
The final dictionary covers ~44.8k unique German words with 70k entries total (pronunciation variants). Since the licensing of the BAS dictionaries is unclear, they are not included into the phoneme dictionary by default. You can however enable them by editing the header of run.sh and setting use_BAS_dictionaries to true.

build_big_lexicon.py can import many dictionaries in the [BasSAMPA](http://www.bas.uni-muenchen.de/Bas/BasSAMPA)  format and merge them into a single dictionary. Its parser understand many variants and dialects of BasSAMPA and the adhoc dictionary formats. To support new variants you'll have to edit def guessImportFunc(filename). The output is a serialised python object.

export_lexicon.py will export such a serialised python dictionary into KALDIs [lexion_p.txt](http://kaldi.sourceforge.net/data_prep.html#data_prep_lang_creating) format (this allows to model different phonetic realisations of the same word with probabilities). Stress markers in the phoneme set are grouped with their unstressed equivalents in KALDI using the extra_questions.txt file. It is also possible to generate a CMU Sphinx formated dictionary with the same data using the -spx option. The Sphinx format also allows pronunciation variants, but cannot model probabilities for these variants.
